#etch-a-sketch

This is an assignment from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

This etch-a-sketch project should satisfy all of the assignment criteria, replicate the functionality of the original device, and add some modern features.

Planned Features:
