<h1>etch-a-sketch</h1>

This is an assignment from The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

<h2>Assignment Criteria:</h2>

<li>Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs</li>
<li>Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would</li>
<li>Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad</li>

<h2>Additional features:</h2>

<li>Eraser that returns each square to blank/white</li>
<li>Colour wheel for user to choose drawing colour</li>
<li>Clear button to reset the canvas</li>
<li>Rainbow mode to cycle through a list of colours as you draw</li>
<li>Gray-scale mode to gradually darken each square each time your cursor passes over it</li>
